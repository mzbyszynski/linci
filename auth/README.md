## Auth service
Trying to create a simple js service to handle authorization and generate JWT tokens. Initially I wanted to implement Oauth 2
sign-ins via Google or something but that seemed like more of a hassle for local development and I didn't want to
start having to set up cloud accounts or deal with API keys at this stage, so I decided to role my own for now.

As stated in the main [README](../README.md) this is a sample application with a few different components/services
that I am creating to experiment with feature flags and continuous delivery, so I'm intentially making some
technology choices for experimentation purposes that I might not make if I were actually building this application
for some other purpose. 

Was also considering Spring Security or looking at Python if implementing this from scratch gets tricky.
